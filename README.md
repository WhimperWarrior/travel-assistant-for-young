# Project Name:

Travel Buddy – An AI-Powered Travel Assistant for Young Travelers

# The Problem

Most existing travel guides and blogs are created by adults. Their introductions, recommendations, and perspectives often don’t match the needs or interests of younger travelers—such as kids, teens, and young adults.

Key Gap: Young travelers lack a travel planning resource that is both engaging and age-appropriate.

Motivation: Travel Buddy aims to fill this gap by encouraging young people to explore the world, experience new cultures, and develop a love for travel in a safe and personalized way.

# The AI Solution

Travel Buddy uses artificial intelligence to curate and personalize travel experiences for young users.

Core Features:

Smart Content Analysis: Searches and analyzes online travel blogs to identify destinations and attractions that appeal to younger audiences.

Personalized Travel Plans: Recommends itineraries based on the user’s age, preferences, and interests.

Comprehensive Information: Provides relevant details such as weather forecasts, transportation options, and flight information.

Safety Filtering: Ensures all information and recommendations are verified as safe and appropriate for young users.

AI Travel Companion: During trips, users can log their experiences with AI assistance—writing travel journals and learning about the history and culture of the places they visit.
